%% FONT SHAPE DECLARATIONS FOR ECONSOCART + NATBIB COMPATIBILITY
% 
% ISSUE: The econsocart.cls document class uses the Utopia (put) font family for body text.
%        When natbib is loaded (as it is by econsocart.cls), natbib's citation commands
%        attempt to use font shapes that don't exist in the Utopia font family:
%        - scit (small caps italic) - requested by natbib for certain citation styles
%        - slit (slanted italic) - potentially requested in some contexts
%
% SYMPTOM: LaTeX issues warnings like:
%          "LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `T1/put/m/scit' undefined"
%          "using `T1/put/m/sc' instead"
%
% SOLUTION: Pre-declare these missing font shapes with explicit substitutions before
%           natbib tries to use them. This prevents the warnings while maintaining
%           the correct visual output (LaTeX was already substituting these shapes,
%           but warning about it).
%
% NOTE TO ECONSOCART MAINTAINERS: This workaround wouldn't be needed if either:
%       1. econsocart.cls pre-declared these font shape substitutions, OR
%       2. econsocart.cls configured natbib to avoid requesting these shapes, OR
%       3. The Utopia font family included scit/slit variants
%
% These declarations must come BEFORE any packages that use fonts.

% Declare font shapes ONLY if using econsocart (which uses Utopia/put font)
\@ifclassloaded{econsocart}{%
  % Declare scit (small caps italic) -> map to sc (small caps)
  \DeclareFontShape{T1}{put}{m}{scit}{<-> ssub * put/m/sc}{}%
  \DeclareFontShape{T1}{put}{b}{scit}{<-> ssub * put/b/sc}{}%
  % Declare slit (slanted italic) -> map to sl (slanted)  
  \DeclareFontShape{T1}{put}{m}{slit}{<-> ssub * put/m/sl}{}%
  \DeclareFontShape{T1}{put}{b}{slit}{<-> ssub * put/b/sl}{}%
}{}
