  climate mitigation policies from broader questions about global income redistribution. Our problem of
  separating the welfare benefits of recession mitigation policies from income redistribution in normal times is
  similar, but complicated by our incomplete markets setup. With complete markets, under which there is no
  potential benefit to redistributing consumption across time for any individual household, our measure is
  identical to Negishi weights.</span></p></div>
