% LaTeX path to the root directory of the current project
% from the directory in which this file resides
% and path to _paths-to-inputs which defines the rest of the paths like \FigDir

% FIXED: Use providecommand only - don't override if already set by main document
% This way, when integrated, the main document's PathToRoot is preserved
% When standalone, these will be the first definitions
