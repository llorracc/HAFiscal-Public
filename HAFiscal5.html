 unemployment spell, is that the heightened risk of unemployment during a recession increases the marginal
 value of current income because it helps them build extra precautionary reserves to buffer against the
 extra risk. A second benefit is that, for someone who becomes unemployed some time into the
 recession, the temporary tax reduction will have allowed them to accumulate a larger buffer to
 sustain them during unemployment. Finally, in a recession, there are more people who will have
 experienced a spell of unemployment, and the larger population of beneficiaries means that the
 consequences of the prior mechanism will be greater. But, quantitatively, all of these effects are
 small.</span></p></div>
