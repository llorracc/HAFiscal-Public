# Session Summary: merge-and-build-stabilization

## What we did and why
- Merged `20250612_finish-latexmk-fixes` into `master` while retaining current `docs/` and resolving non-doc conflicts.
- Stabilized LaTeX build order and cross-document refs (appendix-first build, extra final pass).
- Implemented robust SHORT/LONG toggles and normalized markers to LONG canonical form for idempotent round-trips.
- Added pre-commit doc build (SHORT mode) to guard builds locally.

## Key files and commands
- Merge: `git merge --no-commit --no-ff 20250612_finish-latexmk-fixes` → resolved, committed.
- Build script: `reproduce/reproduce_document_pdfs.sh` (appendix-first, extra final pass).
- Toggle scripts: `scripts/HAFiscal_version-short-or-long.sh`, `scripts/toggle-short-long-all.sh`.
- Hook: `.githooks/pre-commit` → `scripts/hooks/pre-commit-docs.sh`.

## Results
- Builds complete; cross-doc ref issue addressed by stable order; remaining warnings are duplicate natbib citations.
- SHORT/LONG round-trip verified by checksums (idempotent after normalization).

## Open threads / risks
- Deduplicate natbib citations (`fagereng_mpc_2021`, `ganongConsumer2019`).
- Push `master` to origin; optionally add a CI workflow to run SHORT builds on PRs.

## Impact
- Safer merges, predictable builds, and reproducible short/long toggling for publication workflows.
