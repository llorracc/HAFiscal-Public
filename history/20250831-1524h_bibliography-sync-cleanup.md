# Bibliography Synchronization and Cleanup Session
## Date: 2025-08-31 15:24h

### What Was Accomplished

**Primary Focus**: Comprehensive bibliography management and synchronization across multiple HAFiscal BibTeX files, preparing for final publication push.

**Key Tasks Completed**:

1. **Bibliography Key Synchronization**:
   - Updated `HAFiscal_paperpile.mapping.txt` with 65 new Paperpile citekey mappings
   - Synchronized citekeys across multiple bibliography files:
     - `system.bib` (79 entries renamed + 79 crossref stubs added)
     - `HAFiscal_formatted.bib` (79 entries renamed)
     - `HAFiscal.bib` (79 entries renamed)
   - Maintained backward compatibility with `@misc` crossref entries

2. **BibTeX File Organization**:
   - Sorted multiple BibTeX files alphabetically by citekey:
     - `HAFiscal.bib` (79 entries)
     - `/tmp/HAFiscal_paperpile_20250831-1255h_export.bib` (78 entries)
     - `/private/tmp/HAFiscal_paperpile_20250831-1213h.bib` (79 entries)
     - `/private/tmp/HAFiscal_paperpile_20250831-1124h.bib` (78 entries)
     - `/private/tmp/HAFiscal_paperpile_20250831-1323h_exported.bib` (78 entries)

3. **Bibliography Cleanup**:
   - Removed "HAFiscal" keywords from all entries in `HAFiscal.bib`
   - Deleted 71 entire keywords fields where "HAFiscal" was the only keyword
   - Modified 72 entries total, preserving other keywords where present

### Key Files Modified

- **Bibliography Files**: `HAFiscal.bib`, `HAFiscal_formatted.bib`, `system.bib`
- **Mapping File**: `HAFiscal_paperpile.mapping.txt`
- **Multiple Temporary BibTeX Files**: Sorted for consistency

### Technical Implementation

- **Python Scripts**: Created robust BibTeX parsing and manipulation scripts
- **Citekey Synchronization**: Automated mapping between Paperpile and original keys
- **Crossref Compatibility**: Added backward compatibility stubs for old citekeys
- **Alphabetical Sorting**: Implemented brace-counting parser for multi-line entries

### Open Threads and Next Steps

**Pending Tasks**:
- Run `sudo mktexlsr` to refresh TeX filename database after `system.bib` changes
- Rebuild document and verify no unresolved citations after bibliography updates

**Risks**:
- System-wide `system.bib` changes need TeX database refresh
- Bibliography synchronization needs compilation testing

### Impact

- **Publication Ready**: Bibliography is now clean, organized, and synchronized
- **Maintainability**: Alphabetical sorting makes files easier to navigate
- **Compatibility**: Crossref entries ensure old citations still work
- **Professional**: Removed project-specific keywords for general use

### Context for Next Session

This session focused on the technical infrastructure for bibliography management. The next session should focus on final publication preparation, including document compilation testing, final formatting checks, and any remaining publication requirements.
