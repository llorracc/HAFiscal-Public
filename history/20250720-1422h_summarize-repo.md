# HAFiscal Repository Summary
*Generated on 2025-07-20 at 14:22*

## Overview

The **HAFiscal** repository contains the complete software archive for the paper "Welfare and Spending Effects of Consumption Stimulus Policies" by Carroll, Crawley, Du, Frankovic, and Tretvoll (2025), forthcoming in *Quantitative Economics*.

## Research Purpose

This research evaluates the effectiveness of three fiscal stimulus policies commonly used during recessions:
1. **Unemployment Insurance (UI) extensions**
2. **Stimulus checks** (means-tested transfers)
3. **Payroll tax cuts** (temporary wage tax reductions)

The study uses a heterogeneous agent (HA) model calibrated to match empirical spending dynamics following income shocks, specifically the intertemporal marginal propensity to consume (iMPC) patterns documented by Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik (2021).

## Key Findings

- **UI extensions** provide the highest "bang for the buck" in utility terms
- **Stimulus checks** are second-best and offer advantages of speed and scalability
- **Payroll tax cuts** are considerably less effective, especially without multipliers
- The model incorporates "splurge behavior" to capture excess initial spending observed in data
- Results are evaluated using both spending and welfare metrics

## Computational Workflow

The research follows a 5-step computational process:

1. **Step 1** (~20 min): Estimate splurge factor and create Figure 1
2. **Step 2** (~21 hours): Estimate discount factor distributions, create Figure 2
3. **Step 3** (optional): Robustness analysis with splurge=0
4. **Step 4** (~1 hour): Solve HANK and SAM models, create Figure 5
5. **Step 5** (~65 hours): Compare fiscal policies, create Figures 4,6 and Tables 4-8
