# Session Summary: branch-reconciliation-plan

## What we did and why
- Finalized prompt workflow and tracking (`prompts_local/`) so we can coordinate multi-step git operations cleanly.
- Stabilized LaTeX builds, ensuring predictable behavior while reconciling branches.

## Next focus
- Reconcile `master` and `20250612_finish-latexmk-fixes` branches: identify divergences, enumerate conflicts, decide keep/replace rules (especially for `docs/`), then produce a clean merge or back-merge.

## Key commands to use
- Inspect divergence: `git fetch --all --prune`, `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`.
- Dry-run conflict list: `git checkout 20250612_finish-latexmk-fixes && git merge --no-commit --no-ff master && git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U` (then `git merge --abort`).
- Binary policy: prefer current `master` `docs/` artifacts; re-run builds post-merge.

## Risks
- Large number of binary/HTML artifacts in `docs/` may cause heavy conflict resolution.
- Ensure no uncommitted work on the feature branch before attempting reconciliation.
