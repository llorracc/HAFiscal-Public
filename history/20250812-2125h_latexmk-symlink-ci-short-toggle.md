### Session summary

- Switched to SHORT build mode; fixed toggle script to deterministically set markers; standardized markers across `Subfiles/`.
- Fixed LaTeX build orchestration: appendix→main→appendix pass; updated bibtex wrapper to suppress repeated-entry-only summaries.
- Added robust pre-commit checks (symlinks, file sizes, merge markers, shellcheck, exec bits); set required symlinks and restored link fallout.
- Added PR CI workflow to build docs on PRs to `master`; prepared (but did not enforce) push/PR gating strategy.
- Cleaned `.gitignore` to ignore generated `*-titlepage.pdf`; renamed main-only build script; corrected source paths.

Key changes/files
- `scripts/HAFiscal_version-short-or-long.sh` (toggle update; multi-file support)
- `reproduce/reproduce_document_pdfs.sh`, `reproduce/reproduce_document_pdf_main-only.sh`
- `@resources/latexmk/latexmkrc/tools/bibtex_wrapper.sh`
- `.githooks/pre-commit` (new) and required symlinks across repo
- `.github/workflows/pr-build-docs.yml` (PR CI)

Open threads / risks
- Duplicate-citation warnings remain (e.g., `fagereng_mpc_2021`, `ganongConsumer2019`).
- Need canonical `HAFiscal.bib` completion and dedupe; `system.bib` availability varies by env.
- Decide on CI gating (push vs PR) and required status checks; branch protection on `master`.

Impact
- Reliable SHORT/long toggling; fewer LaTeX false negatives; safer commits; repeatable PR builds.
