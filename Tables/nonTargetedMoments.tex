    \textbf{Note}: Percent of liquid wealth held by each group in the 2004 SCF and in the model, and average MPCs after a lottery win for each group. MPCs are calculated for each individual for the year of a lottery win, taking into account that the win takes place in a random quarter of the year that differs across individuals.}
